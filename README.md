#A website that was supposed to be done a year ago for a class
Using Express for backend and Vue+Pinia for frontend, it's supposed to be able to
authenticate, create tasks, delete and edit them (it should do more).

It's divided in server and client, and to run each you do:
```
npm run dev
```

Maybe I'll update this later when I don't have other stuff to do.
